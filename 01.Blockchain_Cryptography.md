# Blockchain and Crypto

## Purpose of a blockchain

- To have a network of computers agree upon a common state of data.
- No one should have control over the process and any one could be able to participate.
- The term **consensus** is used to describe a network coming to an agreement on the state of the data.
- With reference to digital currency, blockchain is needed to solve the problem of trust.

## Smart Contract Blockchains

- A smart contract is a code that will always run the way it is programmed.
- Provide developers with a way to decentralize where the code runs.
- Code can run without any direct ownership, making it censorship resistant and transparently verifiable.

## Cryptographic Hash Functions

- A **hash function** is a function which takes an input of any size and turns it into a fixed size output.
- Cryptographic hash functions satisfy below properties (Eg: SHA256):
  - Deterministic - One specific input always maps to the same specific output
  - Pseudorandom - It is not possible to guess the output based on the output of similar inputs
  - One-way - If someone gives you a new output, you could not determine an input without guessing
  - Fast to Compute - It must be a quick calculation for a computer
  - Collision-resistant - The chance of a collision should be infinitesimally small

## Brute force hashing

- If we know the hashes of some common inputs, we can bruteforce guess or use a simple table which maps common input to its hash value to find the input(this table is also called as **Rainbow Table**).
  - input -> convert to bytes -> hash the value
- It's important to remember to use a random **salt** which you can add to your input to prevent guessing the data using above method.
